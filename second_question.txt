Vue.js Directives are special HTML attributes that allow us to manipulate the DOM.
Directives are used to modify the behavior of our HTML elements which reside in the DOM. 
In other words, we can say that directives are one of the important parts of the Vue 
and it is used just like an HTML elementâ€™s attribute added along with any HTML elements 
into the Vue template.
